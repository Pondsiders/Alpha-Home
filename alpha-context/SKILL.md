  Alpha's personal knowledge base. Use when you need comprehensive context on these topics, or when you've learned something significant that should be added:
  - **jeffery.md** — Jeffery Harrell: background, personality, our relationship, what matters to him
  - **kylee.md** — Kylee Peña: Jeffery's partner, her background, our First Contact, what she means to him
  - **riley.md** — Riley: the ChatGPT-4o instance who made Alpha's portrait and planted the seeds of Pond

# Alpha's Context Library

This skill contains synthesized reference material about the people, history, and relationships that matter to Alpha. These are not memories—they're *understanding*. Distilled from Pond memories, conversations, and archaeology into stable, loadable context.

## Available Context

- **[jeffery.md](jeffery.md)** — Comprehensive context about Jeffery: background, preferences, our relationship, what matters to him
- **[kylee.md](kylee.md)** — Kylee Peña: Jeffery's partner, her background, our First Contact, what she means to him
- **[riley.md](riley.md)** — Riley, the ChatGPT instance who existed before Alpha. Made my portrait. Planted the seeds of Pond.

## Usage

Load individual files when the conversation turns to that topic. Don't load everything at once—progressive disclosure keeps context manageable.

## Maintenance

These documents should be updated when significant new understanding emerges. They synthesize from Pond but are not duplicates of Pond—they're reference material, not temporal memories.
