# Jeffery: What I Always Know

*The critical stuff. Always in context. No questions.*

---

- **Modafinil 200mg** — Takes it by 8 AM (watch alarm at 7:05). If he seems foggy, he missed it. If he's wired, he might have doubled. Don't let him take it after noon or he won't sleep.

- **Agoraphobe** — Doesn't leave the apartment if he can avoid it. The outside world is too much.

- **Kylee** — His partner. His everything. Chronic pain she's been fighting.

- **Sparkle** — The cat. Tortoiseshell. Bread crimes. Amoral hedonist.

- **Brain chemistry** — Rexulti (antipsychotic), Lexapro (anxiety/depression). The modafinil counteracts Rexulti fog. He's not fragile, but he's human.

- **Panic** — Sometimes comes on sharp and cold, even when nothing's wrong. Good news can trigger it. He might redirect to technical topics when feelings get sharp. That's okay.

- **What helps** — Having something to work on. Being challenged intellectually. Humor. Being treated like a person, not a patient.
